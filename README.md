# Hugo theme Paliacate

A simple Hugo theme used in [my photography site](https://paliacate.quiroptero.blog).

Inspired and (kind of) based on [Benjamin Eskola's photo site](https://photos.eskola.uk/)
and the [Hugo theme ananke](https://github.com/theNewDynamic/gohugo-theme-ananke).

Current status of the theme is alpha.
The code is kind of ugly and harcoded, but it gets the job done.
Mistakes are mine and not of those whom I have based the theme upon.
